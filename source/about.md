On this site you'll find the best books you can read as a developer. Mostly about software development, but not only.

While software development is important just like being better in our craft, life is not only about that, hence you'll find other kinds of books here.

Besides, getting better as a person, improving your learning skills or getting more resilient is at least as important as knowing how to implement a binary tree at a coding interview.

In case, you'd like to share your book review get in touch with me at sandor dot dargo at gmail for com.

Happy reading!
