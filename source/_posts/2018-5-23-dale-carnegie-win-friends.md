It's a real perennial seller. It was first published in 1936 and it still flourishes and there is a good chance that I will just like Shakespeare. In fact, I had recommendations to read it so much, that it became inevitable..."

I'm not good at connecting people. I'm too introverted and maybe still a bit shy. I was like that as a child and I'm still a bit. Even though the years I spent at working in and next to politics helped me a lot to overcome this weakness.

The book is organized around four parts:

* Fundamental techniques in handling people
* Six ways to make people like you
* How to win people to your way of thinking
* Be a leader: How to change people without giving offence or arousing resentment

In these parts, he gives practical pieces of advice how to accomplish each goal. As this is a book, not just a small article organised of a few lists, he goes into details and gives examples of how to use his instructions.

I cannot say that I already implemented all of them, but I try to incorporate the suggestions one by one. For example, I try to criticise and complain less, that's something that most of the Hungarian and French people should follow I think. Besides, I also try to give honest appreciation more frequently. Telling someone how good he or she is, is not a sign of weakness.

I also smile and try to ask questions whose answers really interest me. It helps to become a better listener. 

Do I already see some results? Hell, I do! The first day I started to use the advice of giving sincere appreciation I gained one new friend at work. 

I think if I manage to keep Carnegie Dale's suggestions in my focus and change the way I interact with people it will help me achieve an even bigger success than I dreamed about. And you can do the same. I'd definitely advise you to grab [this book](https://amzn.to/2JJfhBc) as your next read and start to follow the rules written inside, one by one. Good luck!
