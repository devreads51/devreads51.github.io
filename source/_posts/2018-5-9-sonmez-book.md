header: "This latest book of <a href=\"https://simpleprogrammer.com/\">John Sonmez</a> is an admirable result of self-discipline. The product of an author/programmer who doesn't just preach about doing things, but he shows us the way by example. Maybe the form of his book is unconventional, but he wrote it in a way that would fit his ways of doing things."

You might have read my [post about how I organize my activities](/blog/2018/02/28/setting-yourself-up-to-succeed) and I mentioned a kind of a kanban board I use, that I took from [Sonmez](https://simpleprogrammer.com/). His [Career Guide](http://amzn.to/2HE30fK) is organized into 60 chapters on almost 800 pages so that he could easily broke his tasks down into daily pomodori fitting his kanban board.

So the book is like a huge collection of blog posts - and in fact it is -, but that's an advantage of it. Luckily the chapters are quite well organized and the book offers you a nice reading experience both by reading cover to cover or by jusdt picking a few chapters.

Obvisouly I don't want to summarize the 80 chapters here. But if you'd like to know more about the different types of employments, if you want to have another - relevant - opinion on how to advance your career, how to search for a job, how to negotiate, read [this book](http://amzn.to/2HE30fK) or read a few articles at [Simple Programmer](https://simpleprogrammer.com/).

What I like the most about [this book](http://amzn.to/2HE30fK) is that the author doesn't just bullshit around. Sonmez writes about sensitive topics and he shares his own opinions even when they are out of the mainstream. Kudos!
