header: "We are living in a world where anywhere you turn, someone will bark in your face how successful he or she is. How much he likes his life and that if you are not a zillionaire by the age of 30 you are nothing but a douchebag. Okay, this might sound like a little bit of exaggeration, but not that much to be honest."
